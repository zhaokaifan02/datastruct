# 1   
T=aaabaaabc P = aab  
aab and aaa  
aab and aab  
aab and aba  
aab and baa  
aab and aaa  
aab and aab  
aab and abc  
For comparisons between P[1..m] and T[i...i+m-1]  nums = 7
For char compare nums = 7*3 = 21  
# 2
set：len(T) = M,len(P) = N  
For each sub Patter of T we have to compare N-M+1 times.  
And for each compare, we will compare N chars,so the time we use is N*(N-M+1)  
So the **time complexity** is O(n^2)

题目比较难理解  
Find the values $\pi[1]$,$\pi[2]$,$\pi[3]$ defined by the following equations;  
P = aab, Q = abc, R = aaa

For P:  
$\pi[1] = 0$  
$\pi[2] = 0$  
$\pi[3] = 0$  
For Q:  
$\pi[1] = 0$  
$\pi[2] = 0$  
$\pi[3] = 0$  
For R:  
$\pi[1] = 0$  
$\pi[2] = 1$  
$\pi[3] = 2$

First we need get $\pi$  
$\pi[1] $ = 0  
$\pi[2] $ = 1  
$\pi[3]$ =  0  
   
  

i = 1 q=1 (1,1)  
i = 2 q=2 (2,2)  
i = 3 w1->q=1 q=2 (3,2)  
i = 4 q=3 q==m print"2" q=0 (4,0)  
i = 5 q = 1 (5,1)  
i = 6 q

# 5
the worst is P is $\pi{q}$ always zero, that means need to do
On and set the $\pi{q}$ si Om
so the answer si On(m+n)
